## Usage of LLMs and other Generative AI tools

We would prefer if you did not use LLMs and other generative AI tools to write critical parts of the code. They produce lots of security issues most of the time, some of which can be caught with `gosec` so please make sure to use the proper static analysis tools and best practices with these tools.
